# Dual-Band SIW Antenna for WBAN Applications

Dual-band Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW) antenna for Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN). Operating at ISM (2.4-2.5 GHz) and UWB (3.1-4.8 GHz) bands.

## Project Overview

Master's thesis project focusing on the design and simulation of a compact dual-band SIW cavity antenna for wearable applications.
